Goal (incl. success criteria):
- Rename and update documentation to use RTUI (not RepoTUI) and align names/paths with current folder.

Constraints/Assumptions:
- Follow AGENTS.md: start with hi + confirm doc scope; telegraph style; minimal tokens; ASCII only.
- Use existing docs as source of truth; adjust names/paths accordingly.

Key decisions:
- Renamed docs to RTUI_* and replaced product/module/config names to rtui.
- AGENTS_.md will be ignored (not restored).

State:
  Done:
  - Renamed files: RTUI_PRODUCT_DOC.md, RTUI_TESTING.md, RTUI_PHASES.md.
  - Replaced RepoTUI/repotui references across docs and AGENTS.md.
  - Marked AGENTS_.md as ignored (no restore).
  Now:
  - Await next instruction (commit/push if requested).
  Next:
  - None.

Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
- None.

Working set (files/ids/commands):
- RTUI_PRODUCT_DOC.md
- RTUI_TESTING.md
- RTUI_PHASES.md
- AGENTS.md
- CONTINUITY.md
