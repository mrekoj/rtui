Goal (incl. success criteria):
- Set up git in current repo, add .gitignore, set remote origin, set main branch, and push to GitHub.

Constraints/Assumptions:
- Follow AGENTS.md: start with hi + confirm doc scope; telegraph style; minimal tokens; ASCII only.
- Do not use destructive commands without explicit user ok.
- Use danger-full-access; no approval prompts.

Key decisions:
- .gitignore will follow standard Go + OS/editor ignores unless user specifies otherwise.

State:
  Done:
  - Updated REPOTUI_PRODUCT_DOC.md earlier per clarified decisions.
  Now:
  - Initialize git if needed, add .gitignore, add remote, set main branch, push.
  Next:
  - Confirm remote/push success; report results.

Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
- UNCONFIRMED: Add standard Go .gitignore unless you want a custom one.

Working set (files/ids/commands):
- .gitignore (to add)
- CONTINUITY.md
